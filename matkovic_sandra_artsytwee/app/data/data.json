    "summary" : "Drawing and painting flowers may seem like a first-year art student's assignment, but Lorenzo Garcia brings depth, shadows, light, form and color to new heights with his unique and revolutionary technique of painting on canvas with ceramic glaze. This session is sure to be a hit with mixed media buffs.",
    "description": "<p>Conscious of his failure in the field of rural genre, van Gogh decided to return to the city. He planned to go to Paris in the hope that the new movements in Parisian painting, of which he had heard from his brother, might provide him with new directions for his work. To prepare himself for this encounter with Paris and its urban population and motifs van Gogh went to the Belgian port of Antwerp. He spent three months in Antwerp where he visited the museums and carefully studied the portraiture and colourist palette of Frans Hals and Rubens. He created a series of experimental portraits in which he tried to apply what he learned from them. From the very start, van Gogh saw his time in Antwerp as an intermezzo before he moved on to Paris, capital of the nineteenth century.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Dutch painter. He was the son of an architectural and genre painter Jan Grasdorp (1651-1693). Willem, according to Arnold Houbraken, was apprenticed in 1697 to the Hamburg still-life painter Ernst Stuven (c.1660-1712), who is purported to have treated him badly and provoked a lawsuit. Grasdorp subsequently became a specialist in flower and fruit still-lifes. Little is known of his life. His only recorded dated work was of 1710 and he is known to have exhibited two fruit still-lifes in the Amsterdam Town Hall the following year. In the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum, Braunschweig, there is another still-life of grapes, peaches, and flowers by the artist. Grasdorp's compositions, especially his flower pieces, have been likened to those of the women painters, Rachel Ruysch and Maria van Oosterwijk, while his hard and exacting execution recalls the polish of Abraham Mignon and Elias van den Broeck. The last mentioned provides the closest stylistic parallels. While Grasdorp was active in the eighteenth century, his art is entirely grounded in the pictorial conventions of the previous century.  </p>",

    "description": "<p>The construction of the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella began in 1246, and was essentially complete by the start of the fourteenth century. The Strozzi Chapel at the end of the left transept, initiated by the sons of Rosso di Gerio Strozzi (died in 1316), was added between 1340 and 1348. The Strozzi were one of the Florentine families that attained considerable wealth and influence through their trading and banking businesses beginning in the early fourteenth century.The Strozzi Chapel contains one of the most important altarpieces of the Trecento, painted by Orcagna (Andrea di Cione) between 1354 and 1357. The frescoes in the chapel were probably painted at the same time as the retable by Nardo di Cione, the brother of Orcagna. In nearly a complete departure from earlier family chapels, the fresco program is devoted almost exclusively to a depiction of the Last Judgment, which takes up all three walls. The pictorial program of the frescoes is articulated like a triptych, with the Last Judgment on the west wall as the core of the ensemble and Paradise on the south wall as the pendant to Hell on the north wall.</p>",

The original is housed at the Museo Dolores Olmedo in Xochimilco, Mexico City, Mexico.  As with many of her self-portraits, pain and suffering is the focus of the work,  though unlike many of her other works, which include parrots, dogs, monkeys and other people, in this painting, Kahlo is alone. Her solitary presence on a cracked and barren landscape symbolize both her isolation and the external forces which have impacted her life. As an earthquake might fissure the landscape, Kahlo's accident broke her body. </p>",

    "description":"<p>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (The Young Ladies of Avignon, and originally titled The Brothel of Avignon) is a large oil painting created in 1907 by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso (1881–1973). The work portrays five nude female prostitutes from a brothel on Carrer d'Avinyó (Avinyó Street) in Barcelona. Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none are conventionally feminine. The women appear as slightly menacing and rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes. Three figures on the left exhibit facial features in the Iberian style of Picasso's native Spain, while the two on the right are shown with African mask-like features. The racial primitivism evoked in these masks, according to Picasso, moved him to liberate an utterly original artistic style of compelling, even savage force.</p>",

During the course of his career, he experienced many different art forms, and experimented   with a few styles, allowing him to further his points of expression, and the design pieces which he created during the illustrious and extensive career that he had. </p>",

    "description": "<p>French painter, founder and leader of the Impressionist movement in France; indeed the movement's name, Impressionism, is derived from his Impression, Sunrise (1873; Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris). He adhered to its principles throughout his long career and is considered the most consistently representative painter of the school as well as one of the foremost painters of landscape in the history of art. As a youth in Le Havre, Monet was encouraged by the marine painter Boudin to paint in the open air, a practice he never forsook. After two years (1860-62) with the army in Algeria, he went to Paris, over parental objections, to study painting. In Paris, Monet formed lasting friendships with the artists who would become the major impressionists, including Pissarro, Cézanne, Renoir, Sisley, and Bazille. He and several of his friends painted for a time out-of-doors in the Barbizon district. Renoir and Monet began painting outdoors together in the late 1860s, laying the foundations of Impressionism.Monet soon began to concern himself with his lifelong objective: portraying the variations of light and atmosphere brought on by changes of hour and season. Rather than copy in the Louvre, the traditional practice of young artists, Monet learned from his friends, from the landscape itself, and from the works of his older contemporaries Manet, Corot, and Courbet. Monet's representation of light was based on his knowledge of the laws of optics as well as his own observations of his subjects. He often showed natural colour by breaking it down into its different components as a prism does. Eliminating black and gray from his palette, Monet rejected entirely the academic approach to landscape.</p>",

It does not mean anything, because mystery means nothing, it is unknowable. --- The Lovers I, 1928 by Rene Magritte. The Lovers I (1928), is one of a small group of pictures painted by Magritte in Paris in 1927-28, in which the identity of the figures is mysteriously shrouded in white cloth. ...
